Rust Zumwalt project
====================
This is an unofficial fork of Magma. Source code were obtained with decompiler and corrected by me (Riketta).  
  
**ZumwaltProject full compatible with Magma plugins.**   
  
To use it you need to add a reference to the project (Zumwalt) patched Assembly-CSharp through Zumwalt_Patcher.  
All code already updated and work. Just compile it or download from *releases*.  
  
*I hope that the community will help me develop this project.*  
Use Git Issues system for report bugs, please. Or send me e-mails. =)

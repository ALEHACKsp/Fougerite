Rust Zumwalt project
====================
This is an unofficial fork of the project. Source code were obtained with decompiler and corrected by me.  

Currently does not work.  

To use it you need to add a reference to the project (Zumwalt) patched Assembly-CSharp through Zumwalt_Patcher.  
Zumwalt_Patcher just not yet ready to go because it is out of date (it is for version 1.0 - this patcher developed by Fox).  
We want to upgrade to the latest version patcher, adding missing hooks to inject patcher Library Assembly-CSharp.  
List of actual hooks for Magma version 1.1.5 you may found in "*MagmaAssembly.diff*".
Once the patcher will be ready project can be considered a work completely.
Zumwalt source code does not currently work only because patcher is old.  
  
  
*I hope that the community will help me to restore to a new Magma face and develop this project.*
